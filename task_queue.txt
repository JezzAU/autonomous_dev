# Autonomous Development Task Queue
#
# Instructions:
# - One task per line
# - Tasks are processed in order (FIFO)
# - Lines starting with # are ignored
# - Empty lines are ignored
#
# Task Format Examples:
# - "Implement CacheManager from forge.aiuml/design/components/cache.aiuml following ADR-003"
# - "Write unit tests for CacheManager with >80% coverage"
# - "Fix bug #42: Null pointer in NavigationService.goto_entity()"
# - "Add documentation for SecurityService public methods"
#
# Tips:
# - Be specific (reference design files, ADRs, bug numbers)
# - One task = one logical unit of work
# - Keep tasks focused (30-60 min each)
# - Complex work = multiple tasks
#
# The supervisor will process these autonomously during configured hours
# (default: 10 PM - 6 AM night shift = 8 hours)

# Example tasks (uncomment to use):
# Implement StorageManager from forge.aiuml/design/components/storage.aiuml
# Write unit tests for StorageManager
# Run validation and fix any BLOCKED methods
# Update CLAUDE.md with latest architecture changes
